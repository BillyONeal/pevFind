Get visit paths:
1. Push in NOTs
2. Start at leaves of tree, and combine at each step.
   * Maintain two lists, the known visit set and the no visit set.
   * Combine at ORs by unioning the known visit sets, and intersecting no visit sets.
   * Combine at ANDs by intersecting known visit sets, and unioning no visit sets.
   * The pattern "vfindregex" creates a visit set with the rooting path.
   * The pattern "!vfindregex" creates a no visit set with the rooting path.

Changes in 1.5.16:
* Process listing and enumeration routines are replaced with those taken from
  Instalog.
* Verifying presence of a siguature is no longer supported. Signatures are
  either valid or not valid. The "3" in the #p format string is replaced with
  "signature valid" rather than "authenticode signature present", and the -ti
  switch is removed.
* Fixed a bug in signature checking. Previously, if a signature was found in
  a catalog for a file, even if that signature was not trusted, the file was
  reported signed. Now, files are only reported signed if there is a trusted
  root certificate at the root of the signing chain.
* Fixed a bug which caused hashing functions to fail on Windows XP.
